Hello! I'm Hashibuzzaman Bhuiyan 
To program an Arduino Nano to make an LED glow using the " digitalWrite()" function and a delay of 1000 milliseconds, you can follow these steps:

1. Connect the LED to one of the digital pins on the Arduino Nano. For example, connect the positive leg (longer leg) of the LED to pin D3 and the negative leg (shorter leg) to GND.

2. Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.

3. Select the correct board and port under the "Tools" menu.


4. In the new sketch, paste the following code :

5. Verify the code by clicking on the "Verify" button (checkmark icon).

6. Upload the code to the Arduino Nano by clicking on the "Upload" button (right arrow icon).

7. The LED connected to pin D3 should start glowing .

Note: Make sure to select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE before uploading the code. Also, double-check the connection of the LED to the correct pin.
